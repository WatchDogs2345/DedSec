<h1>Hello all DedSec Fans!</h1>
<p>If you are a fan of WatchDogs or the sequel, come here for pictures and more!</p>
<h1>First of all, my overall favorite character form the sequel, is Marcus, as for the first one, I have not not played that one yet, but if I ever do, I will inform you.</h1>
<p>My second favorite character would have to be Wrench, I mean who doesn't like Wrench, he is chill, cool, and funny.</p>
